# A guide to building your own game with Downstream

## Welcome!

This page is your one stop shop for learning how to build on top of Downstream!

This guide is aimed at teaching you how to claim a zone in Downstream and deploy your own map. You will be taught how to set up Metamask, get yourself some ETH, bridge it to Redstone, claim your zone and then how to author and deploy a map to your zone!

If you would like to learn how to develop at a much deeper level in Downstream, follow the Advanced Tutorials.

Specific questions? Drop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/MvYb9PBjGW) where you can have direct access to the Playmint dev team!
